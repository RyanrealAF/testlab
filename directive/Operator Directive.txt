Knowledge Archive Migration Directive
1. Architectural Intent
This archive treats personal experience and technical analysis as a single maturation pipeline.
* Core Principle: Data is not split by genre, but by "Maturation Stage."
* Goal: Transform raw NotebookLM exports into a queryable, formalized knowledge base.
2. Structural Specification
The archive-root follows a Pattern-Domain > Maturation-Stage hierarchy.
* [pattern-domain]/experiential_data/: Raw accounts, high texture.
* [pattern-domain]/analytical_synthesis/: Pattern articulation, partial theory.
* [pattern-domain]/formalized_frameworks/: Refined, minimal narrative, teaching-ready.
3. Metadata Schema (Required YAML)
Every document must contain:
* patterndomain: (Matches top-level directory)
* maturationstage: (experientialdata | analyticalsynthesis | formalizedframework)
* patterntags: array of tags from taxonomy/pattern_tags.json
* validationstatus: (singleobservation | multiinstanceconfirmation | framework_ready)
* instructionalreadiness: (internalreference | synthesisinprogress | teaching_ready)
* temporal_context: { experience_date: ISO-8601, analysis_date: ISO-8601 }
* provenance: (personaldocumentation | collaborativework | external_synthesis)
* source: "notebooklm"
* import_date: ISO-8601
4. Processing Pipeline
1. Staging: All raw files in notebooklm-import-raw/.
2. Classification: Generate classification-manifest.csv. User populates metadata.
3. Execution: Script reads manifest, injects YAML frontmatter, creates directories, and moves files.
4. Indexing: Script generates markdown files in _indexes/ based on metadata.
5. Quality Control
* No PII in filenames.
* Filenames: domain-prefix-slug-date.md (lowercase-kebab-case).
* Automated validation of controlled vocabulary against taxonomy/*.json.
